## Short description of the project
This project involves coding a sentiment classifier on the IMDB sentiment dataset. It is divided in three main parts:
* Pre-processing data: getting the data and remove unuseful features in order to work on clean data.
* Naive Bayes Classifier: Implementation of a classifier based on conditional probabilities and another one which is using sickit-learn.
* Stemming and Lemmatization: Adding stemming or lemmatization to the pretreatment.
